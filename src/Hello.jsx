                This site documents a crash course aka bootcamp in coding learing, undertaken by me Gavin Simpson (about me) starting in November 2021.         </p>
            <p>
                My objectives of doing the course  are: 
            </p>  
            <p>-	Develop an understanding of coding, testing and software development principles.</p>  
            <p>-	Learn to do some basic coding; and </p>  
            <p>-	Experience living in another country.</p>  
            
            <p>The first two are enablers around my company's strategy to pivot towards developing accounting software (www.cloudfinance.co). 
            
            The final one is a personal goal tick box. 
            
            Hopefully sharing progress on this site will give some social accountability or at track my progress.  
            </p>
