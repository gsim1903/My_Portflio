        <p>
        I was raised in Halkirk, Caithness in The Highlands of Scotland by some kind, caring folk aka my parents and have had the opportunity to pursue many things. Thanks for that. I like family, friends, football, music, creating, learning, eating, drinking, holidays and laughing. Laughing is underrated. 

        There's more about me throughout the site. Feel free to get in touch.
